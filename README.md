## Contextual Relationships for Abnormal Cervical Cell Detection

This is the code implementation of [Exploring Contextual Relationships for Cervical Abnormal Cell Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04693). 
Our code is built on the basis of MMDetection.

MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the OpenMMLab project developed by [Multimedia Laboratory, CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.6** and [**MMDetection v2.6.0**](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).

## Datasets

We collected a liquid-based cervical cytology images dataset, called Cervical Cell Detection (CCD) dataset. The CCD dataset consists of 40,000 pathological images, 30,000 training, 5,000 validation and 5,000 testing. All annotated instances belong to 10 categories i.e., negative for intraepithelial lesion for malignancy (NILM), atypical squamous cells-undetermined significance (ASCUS), atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude HSIL (ASCH), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), atypical glandular cells (AGC), vaginalis trichomoniasis (VAG), monilia (MON), dysbacteriosis (DYS) and endocervical cells (EC), etc. Annotated NILM cells are used to assist model training, but are not involved in mAP computation.

## Method

![method](demo/flowchart.jpg)
The implementation of the GRAM and RRAM is in [roi_attention_head.py](mmdet/models/roi_heads/bbox_heads/roi_attention_head.py).
